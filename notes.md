ToDo: 
- probably color change for Lab
- Settings style change (looks ugly!!!)
- Boss every 5th? floor

Notes: 
- Different fighting areas for different artifacts?
- Restart with a % of money/mana
- Every 5 levels there's a boss that gives an artifact?
- Total prestige? (New Game+)
- Fighting bug (beat monster, then pause) (honestly, it's a feature)


Events:
- Double Money

New Game+:
- Another orb
- More upgrades
- Artifacts
- More monsters 

Ideas: 
- Achievements
- Magic/Spells

Artifacts: 
- Shadow (Chance to summon a shadow clone of orbs)
- Agile (Orbs lose less velocity from a bad angled bounce)
- Holy Click
