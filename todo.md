ToDo: 
- probably color change for Lab
- Settings style change (looks ugly!!!)

Notes: 
- Cost of basic orb increases to much per purchase??? (increase linearly not compounding?)
- Too many prestiges to unlock fighting? (should be three?)
- Different fighting areas for different artifacts?
- Restart with a % of money/mana
- gui that give info on the monster tower
- Every 5 levels there's a boss that gives an artifact?
- Total prestige?
- Fighting bug (beat monster, then pause) (honestly, it's a feature)


Events:

- Double Money

Settings:
