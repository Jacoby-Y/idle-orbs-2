ToDo: 
- Settings tab
- probably color change for Lab
- Load and save from a string of text!
- sub spore cash hold is too much
- large explosion bigger for circle render mode
- shift buy double and format cost
- close shop when clicking fighting btn, not whenever fighting
- Fighting bug (beat monster, then pause)
- Bug: fight monster, can't toggle shop again unless you click screen

Notes: 
- Cost of basic orb increases to much per purchase??? (increase linearly not compounding?)
- Too many prestiges to unlock fighting? (should be three?)
- Different fighting areas for different artifacts?
- Restart with a % of money/mana
- gui that give info on the monster tower
- Every 5 levels there's a boss that gives an artifact?
- Total prestige?
